  <h1>Turing Test</h1>
	<p>For centuries philosophers have argued about whether a machine could simulate human intelligence, and, conversely, whether the human brain is no more than a machine running a glorified computer program. 
	</p><img src = "pics/turing.png" class = "contentImage" alt = "Turing Test" title = "Turing Test">
	<p>The issue has sharply divided people. Some find the idea preposterous, insane, or even blasphemous, while others believe that artificial intelligence is inevitable and that eventually we will develop machines that are just as intelligent as us. A more balanced view is that artificial intelligence is neither preposterous nor inevitable; while no present computer programs exhibit "intelligence" in any broad sense, the question of whether they are capable of doing so is an experimental one that has not yet been answered either way.</p>
	
	<p>In the late 1940s a British mathematician, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" target = "_blank">Alan Turing</a>, proposed an interesting approach to establishing intelligence.</p>

	<p> Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine that is designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation is a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. </p>
	<p>The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel such as a computer keyboard and screen so that the result would not be dependent on the machine's ability to render words as speech. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human (Turing originally suggested that the machine would convince a human 70% of the time after five minutes of conversation), the machine is said to have passed the test. The test does not check the ability to give correct answers to questions, only how closely answers resemble those a human would give.  </p>
	<h2>Passing the Turing test</h2>
	<p>A computer program by the name of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Goostman" target = "_blank">Eugene Goostman</a> as successfully passed The Turing Test.  It is controversial on whethor it was a valid test or not.  He did so with the following criteria</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Posed as a 13 year old boy</li>
		<li>Intentionally had a bad grasp of English</li>
		<li>Relied on humor to confuse judges</li>
		<li>Repeated unintelligible responses</li>
		
	</ol>
